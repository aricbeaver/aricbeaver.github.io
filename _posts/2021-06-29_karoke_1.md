Aat first I was afraid. I was petrified. Knowing I could never live without you
by myside. I spent so many nights alone. THinking I could never be. I grew strong,
I learned... How. TO get along and now your back.
From outer space. I just walked in to find you here with that sad
look upon your face. I should have made you give the key, I should have 
changed the stupid lock.
If I'd have knoown,
Just for one second,
You'd be back to bother me! 
Oh now go. walk out the door now.
You're not welcome any more. 
La di da di a--

Ok, thank you for that. We are having technical difficulty
and will have to hold off for the next while until it is fixed.
Hopefully we are back up in the next 5. If not well see you next week.

On. Karoke Tuesday!
